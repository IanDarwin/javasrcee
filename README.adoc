= JavaSrcEE

Demos for Java EE.

**NOTE This project is no longer maintained**; it has been merged
back into my main 
https://github.com/javasrc[javasrc] project now that that project
is divided into Maven "modules" aka subdirectories.

This project is as old as the hills, and does contain some really old cruft.

DO NOT take this as best practices. About all I can say ATM is that it compiles,
and a few unit tests pass.

I make no pretense that any of this actually works, so USE AT OWN RISK.

== Note

In Java 9, they have taken pains to separate client code from server code.
The examples in at least jaxwsclient and jaxwsserver will need a bunch of
-addmods command-line args to compile and/or run; see
